    <p>
        I have learnt how to use html.. the different tags in html. i have learnt about Tags and attributes. I learnt that html is the structure of a webpage and that css is known as Cascading Style Sheets. It is used for styling the webpage. it is for aesthetics. ihave also learnt that  it is very broad and you can't actually know everything. I would have to keep learning everyday and i don't have to cram things. I can always surf the internet. Knowing how to use the basic knowledge i've gained is important.
